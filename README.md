## Deep learning balloon anomaly detection
Suite of deep learning solutions for balloon pressure data denoising and anomaly detection. This is work in progress by Quentin Brissaud at NORSAR.

## Data
- Balloon pressure data from the 2019 Ridgecrest campaign can be found here: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.14374067
- .h5 datasets can be built using the notebook "generate_h5_files.ipynb"

## Models
